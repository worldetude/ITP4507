**Laboratory Exercise 8 – Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript (ES 6)**  
## Q1.	Object Creation  
1.	The simplest object oriented construct in JavaScript is it's built in Object data type.  Write an HTML web page with JavaScript code to create an object called “cat” using *new Object*, and adds two properties to it.  The following is a sample output of the web page.

2.	Alternatively, write an HTML web page using object literal to create the object in Q1 (1).   
## Q2.	Constructor and Class in JavaScript (ES6)    
Write JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) code for declaring the class Cat with public attributes name and gender.  Write public method(s) to set and get the properties of the class.  Write an HTML web page with JavaScript code to create a Cat object using the ‘new’ operator.       
The following is a sample output of the web page.

## Q3.	Classical Inheritance using JavaScript (ES6) – extends and super  
You are asked to implement the following class diagram by JavaScript (ECMAScript 6).  You can implement the private attributes name and of Person and books of Author by using the new ECMAScript 2022/ ECMAScript 13 Class Features.

Write an HTML web page with JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) code to implement the above ‘inheritance’ relationship.   
> •	Write the constructors and methods for the two classes (Person and Author).  
> •	Use the constructors to create objects.  Create an object (name='John Smith') of Person class.  Create two objects of Author class.  Use an array to store these two objects.  The names of the two objects are 'Dustin Diaz' and 'Ross Harmes' while the books of the two objects are the same, ['JavaScript Design Patterns'].  
> •	Display the objects’ attributes in the console.  You should use the get methods to retrieve the attributes and the following is a sample output in the console.

## Q4.	Classical Inheritance using JavaScript (ES2022/ES13) – Method Overriding   
You are asked to implement the following class diagram by JavaScript (ECMAScript 2022/ ECMAScript 13).  You can implement the private attributes x and y of Shape, size of Square, and radius of Circle by using the new Class Features of ECMAScript 2022/ECMAScript 13.  
  
Write an HTML web page with JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) code to implement the above ‘inheritance’ relationships.    
    
> •	Write the constructors and methods for the classes (Shape, Square, Circle).  
> •	Use the constructors to create objects.  Create an object (x=10, y=10, size=20) of Square class.  Create an object (x=50, y=50, radius=5) of Circle class.  Use an array to store these two objects.   
> •	Display the objects’ attributes in the console.  You should use the get methods to retrieve the x, y, width, height and area of the objects and the following is a sample output in the console.
